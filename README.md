#  Online Store
- Welcome to the React Redux E-commerce Cart Project!
- [Deployed Site](https://beamish-lokum-63ecc3.netlify.app/)

## Introduction

This project is a hands-on exploration of React and Redux, aimed at building a functional e-commerce application. In this application, I've implemented a range of features that simulate an online shopping experience. Users can browse and select products and add them to a cart. All this while incorporating real-time data management using Firebase.

## Key project highlights
- Fetching Product Data: I've developed an app that retrieves product information from a dummy API and displays it for users to browse.

- Cart Functionality: Users can add products to their shopping cart, which involves managing the cart state with Redux.

- Firebase Integration: We've integrated Firebase to store and manage cart data in real-time. This means that user cart contents are securely saved and accessible even after they leave the site.

- Cart Management: Users can review and modify the items in their cart. Any changes are instantly reflected in the Firebase database and will be visible the next time they access their cart.

## Technologies

The project utilizes the following technologies:

- JavaScript: The programming language used for the backend logic.
- React JS: JavaScript web framework 
- MySQL: The database management system used to store user information, income, and expenses.
- FireBase - For database integration.
